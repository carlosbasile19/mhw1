                    <h2>Control</h2>
                    <p> The commandment of control says that a business will only survive in the Fastlane when the owner has control or influence over all aspects of it: brand, customer acquisition, distribution channels, cost structure and so on. If you can't change your product, your price or influence in marketing decisions, you don't have control of your business. If you are running a franchise, you are not in control. Your brand, methods, and whole business are subject to the franchiser's business. If you have an affiliate marketing company and all your income comes from Ads on Google Adsense, youâ€™re not in control. Google could change their algorithm to stop displaying your ads, and your business will be over.</p>

                    <h2>Entry</h2>
                    <p>The commandment of entry says that as the entry barriers decrease, competition increases and the road weakens. Easy access roads have a lot more traffic. More traffic produces higher competition, and higher competition creates lower margins for the participants. A classic example of this would be any kind of network marketing business where anyone can create a "company" in 10 minutes.</p>

                    <h2>Need</h2>
                    <p>The commandment of need says that only businesses that solve real-world needs will succeed in the Fastlane. Needs are pain points, service gaps, unsolved problems, or emotional disconnects. According to MJ, ninety percent of all new companies fail because they are based on Founder's "selfish" internal needs and not on external market needs, violating this commandment.</p>

                    <h2>Time</h2>
                    <p>The commandment of time says that a business attached to your time is a job. Any company that earns income exclusive of the owner's time violates the Commandment of Time. To satisfy the commandment of time, it's likely you need to start a business that uses one of The Five Fastlane Business Money System Seedlings: Rental Systems, Computer/Software Systems, Content Systems, Distribution Systems or Human resources Systems. Those are the most common areas of success for real Fastlane businesses. They are business systems that survive on their own, creating a proxy for your time-for-money trade.</p>

                    <h2>Scale</h2>
                    <p>The commandment of scale says that wealth acceleration is limited when your total pool of customers is restricted to a small geographical area. When you violate the Commandment of Scale, you break The Fastlane Wealth Equation. To achieve scale, you must have leverage to increase either reach (units sold) or magnitude (unit profit). Tiny habitats create tiny wealth. Scale is leverage!</p>
